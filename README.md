anomaly detection with accumulate graph

Entern detection folder

python Main.py --graph=acc_email.npy --split=email0.01

acc_email.npy is the graph input with shape (T, N, N), where T is the number of snapshot and N is the number of nodes in the graph

email0.01 contains train_pos_id, train_neg_id, test_pos_id, test_neg_id, train_pos, train_neg, test_pos, test_neg:

train_pos_id is with shape (N,). It indicates the which snapshot the edge (in train_pos) come from

train_pos is with shape (N, 2). Each row i corresponds to a edge in the snapshot train_pos_id[i]

train_neg_id is with shape (N,). It indicates the which snapshot the edge (in train_neg) comes from

train_neg is with shape (N, 2). Each row i corresponds to a non-exist edge (sample for training classifier) in the snapshot train_neg_id[i]

similar for test_pos_id, test_neg_id, test_pos, test_neg

#anomaly detection with time-evolving graph

python Main_statistic.py --graph=sta_email.npy --split=email0.01_sta

parameters are the same as accumulate setting, the only difference is that the graph is time-evolving graph

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

data folder contains the processed email data for our model 

data_sta folder contains corresponding time-evolving graphs

Accumulated Graph and Time-evolving Graph
Typically, there are two ways to model dynamic systems as dynamic graphs, namely, accumulated graph and time-evolving graph. 
The accumulated graph %automatically and incrementally constructs an entire graph using all vertices and edges until the current timestamp. 
In contrast, the time-evolving graph is constructed using vertices and edges only appearing in the current timestamp. 
Therefore, each snapshot represents the graph state at a single instant of time.
